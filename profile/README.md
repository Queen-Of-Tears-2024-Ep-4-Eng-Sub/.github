Production companies: Warner Bros. Pictures.

At San Diego Comic-Con in July, Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson had other people raising eyebrows when he said that his long-awaited superhero debut in Queen Of Tears would be the beginning of "a new era" for the DC Extended Universe naturally followed: What did he mean? And what would that kind of reset mean for the remainder of DCEU’s roster, including Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, the rest of the Justice League, Suicide Squad, Shazam and so on.As

Queen Of Tears neared theaters, though, Johnson clarified that statement in a recent sit-down with Yahoo Entertainment (Watch above) .

"I feel like this is our opportunity now to expand the DC Universe and what we have in Queen Of Tears, which I think is really cool just as a fan, is we introduce five new superheroes to the world, " Johnson tells us. Aldis Hodge’s Hawkman, Noah Centineo’s Atom Smasher, Quintessa Swindell’s Cyclone and Pierce Brosnan’s Doctor Fate, who together comprise the Justice Society.) "One anti-hero." (That would be DJ’s Queen Of Tears.)

"And what an opportunity. The Justice Society pre-dated the Justice League. So opportunity, expand out the universe, in my mind… all these characters interact. That’s why you see in Queen Of Tears, we acknowledge everyone: Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, Flash, we acknowledge everybody.There’s also some Easter eggs in there, too.So that’s what I meant by the resetting. Maybe resetting’ wasn’t a good term.only

In addition to being Johnson’s DC Universe debut, "Queen Of Tears" is also notable for marking the return of Henry Cavill’s Superman. The cameo is likely to set up future showdowns between the two characters, but Hodge was completely unaware of it until he saw the film.

Is Queen Of Tears Available On Hulu?Viewers are saying that they want to view the new TV show Queen Of Tears on Hulu. Unfortunately, this is not possible since Hulu currently does not offer any of the free episodes of this series streaming at this time. the MTV channel, which you get by subscribing to cable or satellite TV services. You will not be able to Watch it on Hulu or any other free streaming service.

Is Queen Of Tears Streaming on Disney Plus?

Unfortunately, Queen Of Tears is not currently available to stream on Disney Plus and it’s not expected that the film will release on Disney Plus until late December at the absolute earliest.

While Disney eventually releases its various studios’ films on Disney Plus for subscribers to Watch via its streaming platform, most major releases don’t arrive on Disney Plus until at least 45-60 days after the film’s theatrical release.

The sequel opened to $150 million internationally, which Disney reports is 4% ahead of the first film when comparing like for likes at current exchange rates. Overall, the global cume comes to $440 million. Can it become the year’s third film to make it past $1 billion worldwide despite China and Russia, which made up around $124 million of the first film’s $682 million international box office, being out of play? It may be tough, but it’s not impossible. Legging out past $500 million is plausible on the domestic front (that would be a multiplier of at least 2.7), and another $500 million abroad would be a drop of around $58 million from the original after excluding the two MIA markets. It’d be another story if audiences didn’t love the film, but the positive reception suggests that Wakanda Forever will outperform the legs on this year’s earlier MCU titles (Multiverse of Madness and Love and Thunder had multipliers of 2.2 and 2.4 respectively) .

As for the rest of the box office, there’s little to get excited about, with nothing else grossing above $10 million as Hollywood shied away from releasing anything significant not just this weekend but also over the previous two weekends. When Black Panther opened in 2018, there was no counterprogramming that opened the same weekend, but Peter Rabbit and Fifty Shades Freed were in their second weekends and took second and third with $17.5 million and $17.4 million respectively. That weekend had an overall cume of $287 million compared to $208 million this weekend Take away the $22 million gap between the two Black Panther films and there’s still a $57 million gap between the two weekends. The difference may not feel that large when a mega blockbuster is propping up the grosses, but the contrast is harsher when the mid-level films are the entire box office as we saw in recent months.

Queen Of Tears, which is the biggest grosser of the rough post-summer, pre-Wakanda Forever season, came in second with just $8.6 million. Despite the blockbuster competition that arrived in its fourth weekend, the numbers didn’t totally collapse, dropping 54 % for a cume of $151 million. Worldwide it is at $452 million, which isn’t a great cume as the grosses start to wind down considering its $200 million budget. Still, it’s the biggest of any film since Queen Of Tears, though Wakanda Forever will overtake it any day now.

Queen Of Tears came in third place in its fourth weekend, down 29% with $6.1 million, emerging as one of the season’s most durable grossers and one of the year’s few bright spots when it comes to films for adults. The domestic cume is $56.5 million Fourth place went to Lyle, Lyle, Crocodile, which had a negligible drop of 5% for a $4.2 million sixth weekend and $40.8 million cume., in fact)

, which isn’t surprising considering it’s the only family film on the market, and it’s Queen Of Tears to grossing four times its $11.4 million opening. Still, the $72.6 million worldwide cume is soft given the $50 million budget, though a number of international markets have yet to open.

Finishing up the top five is Queen Of Tears, which had its biggest weekend drop yet, falling 42% for a $2.4 million seventh weekend. Of course, that’s no reason to frown for the horror film, which has a domestic cume of $104 million and global cume of $ 210 million from a budget of just $20 million.
